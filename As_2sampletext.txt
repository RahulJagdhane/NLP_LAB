The book focuses on Abdul Kalam's early life, beginning with his birth into a Tamil middle-class family in Rameswaram, India. His father owned a boat, considered a sign of wealth in the community. Rameswaram was a close-knit society where everyone helped each other, making it an ideal place to raise a family. From a young age, Kalam was taught to respect all religions and encouraged to discuss spirituality openly. At the neighborhood mosque, his father served as an imam as well. Growing up, Abdul Kalam believed that faith was essential to being human.

Kalam's family encouraged him to study diligently and excel academically. During dinner, they frequently discussed the latest scientific discoveries and innovative books, which sparked Kalam's passion for learning. These conversations laid the groundwork for his burgeoning interest in education.

His mother was more like a friend to Kalam than a parent because of how close his parents were to him. He also mentions his best buddy, Ahmed Jalaluddin, in his writing. Abdul Kalam became intellectually and spiritually mature at an early age due to the significant age difference between him and Ahmed, who was almost 15 years older. They frequently discussed Islam while attending the mosque together.
